Keeping alarms to remind personal stuff is a comman feature nowadays.But more people have an bad habit of snozzing alarms nearly 5 or 10 mins when it start to ringing.  Because of this, unnecessary busy created on people with regard of  lot of problems.
To prevent this drowsy attitude from people, we thought to invent alarm app with special motivatiated features.GeTUp is the app which we build.
Among two themes,Retro is the theme that we selected for this task.
